<p><strong>This site would not be possible without the hard work of the wiki editors at <a href="http://lasthaiku.wikidot.com/">Last Haiku</a>.</strong></p>

<p>That being said, it would appear Last Haiku has been abandoned and I got tired of having to rely on Google to find the things I wanted on Last Haiku. I also found the color scheme hard to read on my aging eyes. While I could fix the colors locally, that wasn't appealing to me. Transfering the content from a wiki to a Drupal site was interesting to me, so here we are. I hope you find this site useful!</p>

<p>There are limits to what this site can do - you'll notice searching for "falcon" never returns a result. This is a limit of the platform and unless I win the megamillions, it's unlikely the added expense of upgrading the search server is going to happen. You can report other bugs <a href="/contact">here</a>. No promises they'll be fixed, but I might!</p>

<p>All Fourth Edition PDFs can be found for sale on <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?ruleSystem=10109">DriveThru RPG</a>. I'd encourage you to purchase the source material as they are all excellent books and extremely high quality (even in PDF form).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
