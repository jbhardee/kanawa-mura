<p>
     The chart here represents typical Honor awards and penalties for notable actions at the various Honor ranks. How these awards and penalties should happen in play is the choice of the GM. Some GMs may wish to simply follow the chart and allow Honor gains and losses automatically, but other GMs may wish to exercise more control and make specific Honor awards and penalties based on the guidelines of this chart. This is ultimately a matter for the GM to decide, preferably in consultation with the players.
